## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-16 — Nexus Security Suite

### Added
- **Email Verification System**: Automatic verification email on registration via Resend. Tokens are 32-byte crypto-random values stored as SHA-256 hashes. 24-hour expiry with resend support.
- **Email Verification Gate**: `/chat` requires a verified email. Unverified users see a sticky `EmailVerificationBanner` with resend + cooldown timer.
- **Verification Pages**: `/verify-email` (7-state handler), `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password` (real-time strength meter + show/hide toggle).
- **Password Reset Flow**: Secure forgot-password → reset-password. Single-use token (nulled after use), 60-minute expiry.
- **IP-Based Rate Limiting**: Sliding-window in-memory limiters on all auth endpoints. Separate implementations for Next.js (`src/lib/rate-limiter.ts`) and Express (`middleware/rateLimiter.js`). Fail-open design.
- **GDPR Cookie Consent Banner**: Slide-up animated banner — Accept All / Reject / Customize with per-category toggles. Persisted in `localStorage`.
- **PostHog Analytics**: Consent-gated analytics, session replay (all inputs masked), and feature flags via `PostHogProvider`.
- **Sentry Error Monitoring**: Backend-only error capture with PII scrubbing (`beforeSend` hook strips password/token/secret fields).
- **Security Headers**: Strict CSP, X-Frame-Options, and nosniff enabled to prevent XSS and clickjacking.
- **Task Management RBAC**: Strictly gated task assignment endpoints; only authorized `creator` roles can assign tasks to crew.
- **Cyberpunk Email Templates**: `src/lib/email-templates/` — HTML templates for verification and password reset matching the platform's cinematic design system.

### Changed
- `routes/users.js`: Registration sends verification email (async, non-blocking). Rate limiters applied to login (5/15min) and register (3/hr). `email_verified` now returned in login and `/me` responses.
- `src/proxy.ts`: Added email verification gate — unverified users are redirected from `/chat` to `/?verify=required`.
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: Wrapped body in `PostHogProvider`. Added `EmailVerificationBanner` and `CookieConsentBanner`.
- `public/styles/pages/project.css`: Centered the Explore (Trending Scripts) section for better UI alignment.
- `public/scripts/pages/project.js`: Implemented conditional rendering for the search bar (hidden if < 10 scripts).
- `public/scripts/components/global-chat-fab.js`: Updated Chat FAB to trigger login toast/modal instead of redirecting.
- `prisma/schema.prisma` + `db push`: Added 6 security fields to `User` model.
- `.env.example`: Documented all new env vars with purpose comments.

### Security
- SHA-256 token hashing — raw tokens never stored in DB.
- Generic success messages on all auth endpoints to prevent email enumeration.
- Sentry `beforeSend` scrubs PII before transmission.
- PostHog identity traits sanitized before sending.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Global Timezone Support**: Admin analytics and charts now natively support Indian Standard Time (IST) out of the box, ensuring midnight resets occur correctly for the target demographic.
- **Cinematic Markdown Documentation**: Complete rewrite of all standard open-source documentation including README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, and ROADMAP.
- **Authentication Engine Solidified**: Cleaned up pre-migration references to third-party identity providers, optimizing our secure JWT session architecture and reducing configuration footprints.

### Changed
- **Codebase Optimization**: Removed all unused components, dead code, and debug spam (`console.log`) across frontend and backend for a smaller bundle size and faster execution.
- **UI Architecture**: Moved multiple Express-served pages into the Next.js App Router for better client-side transitions and SEO.

### Fixed
- **API Response Leaks**: Fixed an issue where raw HTML error pages were leaking to the frontend during failed API requests. All API endpoints now return strict JSON.
- **Realtime Listener Leaks**: Cleaned up unmounted component listeners to prevent Pusher memory leaks.
- **Dashboard Synchronization**: Corrected the SQL `GROUP BY` logic so charts don't misalign dates due to UTC offsets.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
