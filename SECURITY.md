# 🛡️ Security Policy

At TAKE ONE Nexus, the security of our filmmakers' intellectual property (scripts) and personal data is our highest priority. We take security vulnerabilities very seriously and appreciate the efforts of security researchers and our community in keeping our platform safe.

## 🟢 Supported Versions

We currently provide security updates and patches for the following versions of our platform:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| v1.2.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| v1.1.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| v1.0.x  | :x:                |
| v0.x.x  | :x:                |

*(Note: Since we operate as a live SaaS platform, users always interact with the latest production version).*

## 🛑 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we kindly ask that you do **not** report it via public GitHub issues or public forums. Instead, please follow our responsible disclosure process:

1. **Email the core team** at: `alok.r25012@csds.rishihood.edu.in` or `aarushgupta289@gmail.com`.
2. **Include detailed information**: Provide a thorough description of the vulnerability, the environment where it was discovered, and steps to reproduce it. 
3. **Wait for confirmation**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

We will work diligently to validate and fix the vulnerability. Once resolved, we will notify you and may publicly acknowledge your contribution (with your permission).

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

To maintain a secure ecosystem, we adhere to the following practices:

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens stored securely via HTTP-only, secure cookies, ensuring a fully decentralized, robust, and custom-tailored identity validation pipeline.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: All task assignment, creation, and administrative APIs are strictly gated to ensure only authorized users (e.g. `creator`, `admin`) can access them.
- **Moderation Pipeline**: The `PATCH /api/scripts/:id/moderate` endpoint requires `Admin` or `Developer` role via `requireRole()` middleware. All moderation actions are timestamped and attributed to the moderating admin's `user_id`.
- **Scripts Platform Isolation**: The `scripts-platform/` admin tool uses a **separate** JWT secret (`SP_JWT_SECRET`) and cookie (`sp_token`) from the main platform. A compromised main-platform token cannot be used to access the moderation interface.
- **Database**: Parameterized queries using Prisma and prepared SQL statements to prevent SQL Injection.
- **Data Privacy**: Passwords are cryptographically hashed using bcrypt. Sensitive user data is never exposed to the frontend.
- **Token Hashing**: Verification and password-reset tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes in the database. The raw token is transmitted exclusively via email link — never stored plaintext.
- **Rate Limiting**: Global and endpoint-specific rate limiting (Login, Register, Password Reset, Email Delivery, Script Moderation) are enforced on both the Next.js API and legacy Express server.
- **Security Headers**: Strict Content Security Policy (CSP), anti-clickjacking (X-Frame-Options: DENY), and strict referrer policies are enforced globally. The scripts-platform also sets its own `X-Frame-Options: DENY` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` headers.
- **XSS Prevention**: React/Next.js automatically sanitizes inputs, and we strictly validate HTML rendered on static routes.
- **Crawl Protection**: The scripts-platform sets `robots: noindex, nofollow` in its metadata to prevent indexing of the internal moderation tool.
- **Multi-Platform Ingestion Security**: Independent issue reporting modals sanitise text descriptions and scrub input before dispatching telemetry to the database. Standalone routes validate request payloads and restrict admin triage commands exclusively to active admin roles.

Thank you for helping us keep TAKE ONE Nexus secure!

## Critical Fixes: Payment And Moderation Enforcement

- `POST /api/scripts` no longer creates records; it returns `PAYMENT_REQUIRED`.
- Razorpay checkout success is never trusted from the browser. `/api/payments/verify` validates the backend HMAC signature before creating a script.
- Failed, cancelled, invalid, and expired payments delete the draft and do not enter public pages, moderation, or leaderboard counts.
- Script deletion uses the verified session plus a fresh database role lookup. Elevated deletes require primary or secondary `admin`/`moderator`.
- Script deletion is logged as `SCRIPT_DELETED` in `moderation_logs`.
- Admin task approval writes a credit transaction and triggers user-credit and leaderboard refresh events.
