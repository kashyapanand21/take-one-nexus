## 📽️ The Vision

> **Nexus [nɛksəs]:** A connection or series of connections linking two or more things.

TAKE ONE Nexus is the definitive digital ecosystem for the next generation of filmmakers, screenwriters, and creative technocrats. We noticed a major **Problem**: student filmmakers and independent creatives often struggle to find dedicated, skilled crew members for their passion projects. 

**Our Solution**: A platform designed with a cinematic "Director-style" aesthetic that acts as a secure, real-time hub for showcasing portfolios, discovering talent based on creative roles, and forming production crews.

---

## ⚡ Core Features

- **🎭 Cinematic Production Profiles:** Live creator profiles serving as a digital reel, complete with skill badges, production history, and portfolio showcase.
- **🛰️ Secure Transmission (Chat):** Real-time communication suite powered by Pusher. Direct messaging, group chats, live sync, and intelligent unread tracking.
- **🏆 Live Leaderboard:** Real-time community ranking system powered by our internal Credits engine to reward platform engagement.
- **💎 Creator Credits:** The heartbeat of the Nexus economy. Earn credits for collaborations and active participation.
- **🛡️ Developer & Platform Security:** Integrated global bug reporting, role-based admin dashboard, and robust JWT-based session security.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern, scalable hybrid architecture.

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14 (App Router), Vanilla HTML/CSS (Static UI), React |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js |
| **Database** | MySQL (optimized for TiDB Cloud) |
| **ORM** | Prisma |
| **Real-time** | Pusher |
| **Authentication** | JWT stored in secure HTTP-only cookies |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (Hybrid Serverless & Static) |

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

TAKE ONE Nexus utilizes a **dual-server architecture** running side-by-side on Vercel:
- **Next.js App (`src/app/`):** Handles dynamic authenticated routes (e.g., `/profile`, `/chat`, `/admin`).
- **Express Server (`server.js`):** Acts as the API layer (`/api/*`) and serves high-performance static HTML files (`public/*.htm`).

> For a deep dive into the system design, read the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MySQL / TiDB Database
- Pusher Account (for Real-time Chat)
- Git

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alokr25012-lab/take-one-nexus.git
cd take-one-nexus
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example`:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@host:port/database"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your_secure_secret_min_32_chars"

# Real-time Chat (Pusher)
PUSHER_APP_ID="your_app_id"
PUSHER_SECRET="your_secret"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY="your_key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER="your_cluster"

# Local Development API Proxy
LEGACY_API_ORIGIN="http://127.0.0.1:5001"
```

### 4. Database Setup

Initialize your database schema using Prisma:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### 5. Start Local Development

Because of the hybrid architecture, run the Next.js dev server (which proxies API requests to Express):

```bash
npm run dev
```

In a separate terminal, run the Express backend:

```bash
npm run legacy:dev
```

The platform should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🚢 Production Deployment

TAKE ONE Nexus is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**.

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
2. Configure the environment variables in the Vercel Dashboard.
3. Vercel will use the `vercel.json` file to handle complex routing between Next.js and the Express backend automatically.
4. The build command is pre-configured to `prisma generate && next build`.
