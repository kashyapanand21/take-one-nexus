## Vercel Deployment & Database Setup

To deploy this backend to Vercel and connect it to a MySQL database, follow these steps:

### 1. Environment Variables
Add the following environment variables in your Vercel Project Settings:

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `DB_HOST` | MySQL database host |
| `DB_PORT` | MySQL database port (default 3306) |
| `DB_NAME` | Database name |
| `DB_USER` | Database username |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Database password |
| `JWT_SECRET` | A long random string for auth tokens |
| `SMTP_HOST` | SMTP server host (for notifications) |
| `SMTP_PORT` | SMTP server port |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP username |
| `SMTP_PASS` | SMTP password |
## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Setup Environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your details.
   - **IMPORTANT**: Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set to a secure random string.
   - **IMPORTANT**: Ensure all `DB_` variables point to a valid MySQL instance.
3. **Initialize Database**: Run `node database/init.js` to create the schema.
4. **Start Server**: `npm run dev`

## Deployment

This app is designed to be deployed on Vercel. Ensure all environment variables from `.env.example` are added to your Vercel project settings.

### Required Vercel Environment Variables

To ensure the production system works, you **MUST** add these variables in your Vercel Project Settings:

| Variable | Importance | Example / Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DB_HOST` | **CRITICAL** | Your MySQL host (e.g., `aws.connect.com`). Do NOT leave blank. |
| `DB_PORT` | Required | Usually `3306`. |
| `DB_NAME` | Required | Your database name (e.g., `take_one`). |
| `DB_USER` | Required | Your database username. |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Required | Your database password. |
| `JWT_SECRET` | **CRITICAL** | A long random string (e.g., `32+ characters`). |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`| Optional | Comma-separated list of extra CORS origins. |
| `SMTP_HOST` | Required | SMTP server host for notifications. |
| `SMTP_USER` | Required | SMTP username. |
| `SMTP_PASS` | Required | SMTP app password. |

> [!CAUTION]
> If `DB_HOST` is missing, the app will attempt to connect to `127.0.0.1`, which will fail in the Vercel serverless environment with an `ECONNREFUSED` error.

---

### 3. Safe Mode
The API routes are designed with "Safe Empty States". If the database is not yet initialized or becomes unreachable, read-only routes (like the homepage and search) will return empty data (200 OK) instead of crashing with 500 errors. This allows the frontend to load gracefully while you troubleshoot connection issues.
